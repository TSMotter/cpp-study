  How would you declare:

  A pointer to a char
  A constant pointer to a char
  A pointer to a constant char
  A constant pointer to a constant char
  A reference to a char
  A reference to a constant char
*/

#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  // char
  char Z = 0x5A;
  std::cout << "char: " << Z << std::endl;

  // const char
  const char W = 0x57;
  std::cout << "const char:  " << W << std::endl;

  // pointer to char
  char *A = &Z;
  std::cout << "pointer to char: " << A << std::endl;

  // constant pointer to a char
  char *const B = A;
  std::cout << "constant pointer to a char: " << B << std::endl;

  // pointer to a constant char
  const char *C = &W;
  std::cout << "pointer to a constant char: " << C << std::endl;

  // constant pointer to a constant char
  const char *const D = A;
  std::cout << "constant pointer to a constant char: " << D << std::endl;

  // reference to a char
  char &E = Z;
  std::cout << "reference to a char: " << E << std::endl;

  // reference to a constant char
  const char &F = W;
  std::cout << "reference to a constant char: " << F << std::endl;

  return 0;
