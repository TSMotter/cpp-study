# Operating Systems - Basics

- An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages and controls the hardware and software resources of a computer. It is the foundation on which other programs and applications run.

- These are the main roles of an operating system:
  
  - Processor management
  
  - Memory management
  
  - Inputs, outputs, interrupts

  - Security

- These are the main elements of an operating system:

  - Kernel: The kernel is the central component of the operating system that controls the hardware and software resources of the computer. It is responsible for managing the allocation of resources, scheduling processes, and handling input and output requests.

  - System libraries: System libraries are collections of functions and routines that provide services to the operating system and to programs running on the computer. These libraries can include functions for handling input and output, memory management, and system calls.

  - System programs: System programs are programs that are included with the operating system and are used to perform system-level tasks, such as managing the file system, managing users and permissions, and managing system resources.

  - User interface: The user interface is the way in which users interact with the operating system. This can be a graphical user interface (GUI), a command-line interface (CLI), or a combination of both.

  - File system: The file system is the way in which the operating system organizes and stores files on the computer's storage devices. It includes the directories and files, as well as the rules for naming, organizing, and accessing them.

  - Device drivers: Device drivers are programs that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices, such as printers, keyboards, and storage devices. They provide a standard interface between the operating system and the device, allowing different devices to work with the operating
